# ePUx16 Architecture

### Overview
- The ePUx16 is a computer hosted entirely on Excel, and is built primarily with Lambda as metacode, but also includes a 16-bit ALU built completely with logic gates
- This project was made as a fun experiment. It is inspired by the various iterations of Excel Computers seen on Youtube
### Features
- The features of the ePUx16 Architecture are:
   - full eBF language support with 15 different symbols tailored around the development of low-level systems, including operating systems
   - Excel's Lambda as metacode
   - 16-bit central processor, RAM chip, ROM chip, and ALU chip
   - User input
   - Graphical interface (a screen)
### Github Repository Contents
- This Github Repository contains:
    - The full ePUx16 Excel file
    - An independently functioning eBF interpreter and compiler, built in Java
    - A non-Excel simulator of the ePUx16 Architecture, built in Java
    - Documentation on the eBF and eBin languages, and ePUx16 protocols
    - A series of development tools used and built by Nadelio for use in the ePUx16 metacode and OS Environment
    - A VSCode Extension with syntax highlighting for eBF
    - A standard library built for use in the independently functioning eBF language
    - Several miscellanous files from the development process, including diagrams, eBF/eBin keys, and full ePUx16 checklists
