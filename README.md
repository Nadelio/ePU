CPU:

- ALU âœ…  
- Control Unit (Sends commands to *Memory Management Unit* and the *ALU*, reads from/writes to *RAM Unit*, and writes to *Registers* for temporary program storage)  
- Registers  
- Memory Management Unit  
- Clock âœ…

RAM:

- Writing âœ…  
- Reading âœ…  
- Unit ğŸŸ¨

Program Reader/Counter:

- Pointer (Program Reader/Counter will output what it reads into the *Control Unit*) ğŸŸ¨  
- Set to start of program  
- Reset to start of program

Input:

- Input Buffer
  - Reserve a cell that can be typed in and will be read at the *last character in the cell* when Program Counter reaches a `Read Input` instruction
  -> use in OS dev
  -> possibly also game dev?
  - "read input" instruction will keep a copy of the cell before an input to check if an input happened, will update upon reading a new input
    - Add a `Clear Cell` VBA macro that clears the *Input Buffer* (the cell where inputs happen) when the clear command is given by the *Program Counter* to the *Command Unit* (*might be cheating*)

Output:

- Screen (Gets inputs from *Control Unit*)

ROM:

- Writing  
- Reading  
- Unit

Assembly/BF:

- Parser
  - Instruction set
    - BF tokens as 4-bit numbers for storage in ROM/Registers
    - Add in `DPND` instruction
      - Pulls another program into the Registers for use as a function
    - `END` token to signal the end of a program
- Compiler
  - BF instructions -> 4-bit numbers
